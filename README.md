# Ice Cream Shop - C Programming Project  

This project is a **C program** that simulates an interactive ice cream shop ordering system. It demonstrates key programming concepts such as **flow control, nested statements, loops, and conditional statements**.  

## Features  
- Uses a **do-while loop** to continuously accept user orders.  
- Implements **if-else conditions** for selecting ice cream flavors, sizes, and toppings.  
- Provides a **countdown timer** using both **for** and **while loops** to simulate waiting time.  
- Includes a **customer service option** for inquiries.  
- Calculates the **total cost and waiting time** for an order.  
- Follows structured programming principles and best coding practices.  

## Concepts Covered  
✅ Variables & Data Types  
✅ Conditional Statements (**if-else**)  
✅ Looping Constructs (**do-while, for, while**)  
✅ Nested Statements  
✅ User Input Handling  
✅ Braces Simplification for Readability
